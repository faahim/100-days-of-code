# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 8th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Designed the project page of my React portfolio site. It now works. I just need to put all the project details on the page tommorow.

**Thoughts**: SVGs are truly amazing. The flexibility of customization it offers is second to none. It's animateable and very small in size. I'm thinking about using SVGs always unless I have really good reason not to. Ba bye font icons! I gotta explore more about SVG paths and how to animate them.
