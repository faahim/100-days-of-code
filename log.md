# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 8th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Designed the project page of my React portfolio site. It now works. I just need to put all the project details on the page tommorow.

**Thoughts**: SVGs are truly amazing. The flexibility of customization it offers is second to none. It's animateable and very small in size. I'm thinking about using SVGs always unless I have really good reason not to. Ba bye font icons! I gotta explore more about SVG paths and how to animate them.

### Day 1: March 9th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: progressed with the project page of my React portfolio site. The styling is mostly done. I just need to add all the project details to the js object so it renders on the page.

**Thoughts**: I'm still in awe by the awesomeness of SVG! I created an animated sungalss emoji today. It took some time but I enjoyed doing it. I've animate the SVG's path using CSS animation, which I thought wasn't possiblle. But it's simple and easy! On another note, I'm getting into the bad habit of staying up late. It has really bad effects on my productivity. Gotta keep it in check.
