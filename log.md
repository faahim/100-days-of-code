# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1st, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Struggeled with fetching url metadata on client side in geckos-28 react app. Written a method to remove item from shelf.

**Thoughts:** I'm having a hard time understanding the CORS policy. I'm reading some articles to deepen my understannding on it. I'm also afraid that maybe I simply can't fetch cross origin data from the client side!


### Day 1: January 2nd, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Found a way to fix CORS issues using proxy on the client side for the react app.  

**Thoughts**: After a lot of searching and reading, I think I understand CORS on a high level now. I'm using a proxy to fix the issue on the client side but I don't feel like it's a proper solution. Gotta keep researching.
